Drush Module
============

This module manages Drush, a command line shell and scripting interface for
Drupal.

It can install and upgrade Drush from Debian packages, as well as download and
enable projects on Drupal sites, and optionally log its output to a designated
file.


Dependencies
------------

The Aegir module depends on:
 * the Rise-up Labs Shared Common Module (https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/shared-common)
 * the Koumbit Apt Module (https://redmine.koumbit.net/projects/puppet-apt)


Instructions
------------

To use this module, follow these directions:

1. Your modules directory will need all the files included in this
   repository placed under a directory called "drush"

2. Since Debian package installations depends on the Apt module, which in turn
   depends on some functions provided by the Common module, you'll need to add
   the following line in your manifests (ideally to manifests/site.pp):

       import "common"

3. To install Drush, add the following line to your manifests (ideally in
   manifests/nodes.pp):

       include drush

4. To download projects from drupal.org to a site, add lines such as the
   following to your manifests (ideally in manifests/site.pp):

       drush::dl {'token':
         site_path => '/var/aegir/platforms/drupal/sites/example.com',
         log       => '/var/aegir/drush.log',
       }

5. To enable projects on a Drupal site, add lines such as the following to your
   manifests (ideally in manifests/site.pp):

       drush::en {'token':
         site_path => '/var/aegir/platforms/drupal/sites/example.com',
         log       => '/var/aegir/drush.log',
       }
